    <h1>Pricing Foreign Exchange Barrier Options</h1>

      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>
      This paper grew out of a longer-standing interest I’ve had in using simulation to solve problems where closed-form solutions break down. I’d studied European option pricing before, but barrier options seemed like a natural next step—technically richer, more sensitive to model structure, and deeply rooted in practical finance.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      My goal was to understand the complications of pricing path-dependent derivatives and experiment with methods that mitigate the well-known challenges of simulating rare path behavior. I wanted to implement everything from scratch—model, paths, controls, even variance reduction—both to understand how they work and to explore the limits of pure simulation.
      </p>
      
      <h2>An Overview of Barrier Options</h2>
      <p>
      Barrier options are path-dependent derivatives: their payoff depends not only on the price of the underlying asset at maturity, but also on whether the asset’s path crosses a specified level (the “barrier”) during the life of the option.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      A classic example is a down-and-out call. It behaves like a standard European call option unless the asset price falls below a certain barrier during the option’s term, in which case the option immediately becomes worthless. These structures are particularly common in foreign exchange (FX) markets due to their cost-effectiveness and conditional hedging features.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Modeling the FX Rate</h2>
      <p>
      I modeled the FX spot rate \( S_t \) using two stochastic processes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)</strong>: The classical Black-Scholes model under a risk-neutral measure.</li>
        <li><strong>Heston Model</strong>: A stochastic volatility model that better captures empirical phenomena like volatility clustering and leverage effects.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <img src="gbm-paths.png" alt="Sample paths under GBM" style="max-width:100%; margin: 2rem 0; border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 12px;" />
      <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size: 0.95rem;">
      Sample paths of the FX spot rate under geometric Brownian motion used in Monte Carlo simulation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Using Monte Carlo simulation, I generated thousands of synthetic price paths and computed expected payoffs. However, simulating barrier options naïvely introduces significant variance and discretization bias, especially when monitoring is discrete (e.g. daily or hourly).
      </p>
      
      <h2>Variance Reduction and Interpolation</h2>
      <p>
      To improve estimator efficiency, I incorporated several techniques:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Antithetic Variates</strong>: For each simulated path, I also simulate its antithetic complement (by negating the Brownian motion), and average their payoffs to reduce variance.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Variates</strong>: I use a closely related option with known expected value (like a European call) as a control.</li>
        <li><strong>Brownian Bridge Interpolation</strong>: Since discrete sampling can miss barrier crossings, the bridge helps estimate whether the barrier was crossed between time steps.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <img src="brownian-bridge.png" alt="Brownian bridge correction" style="max-width:100%; margin: 2rem 0; border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 12px;" />
      <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size: 0.95rem;">
      Two FX paths (dashed) that survive discrete monitoring yet likely breach the barrier when interpolated. Brownian bridge adjustment penalizes these cases.
      </p>

      
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
      Simulation under GBM gave reasonable estimates but struggled in scenarios with low volatility or tight barriers. The variance reduction techniques dramatically improved convergence and reduced standard error. Brownian bridge interpolation made a measurable difference in correctly classifying knock-outs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The Heston model added computational cost but yielded more realistic dynamics, especially for FX options. It captured “fat tails” and volatility smiles that GBM couldn’t replicate. I ran empirical tests comparing both models across multiple scenarios and found clear tradeoffs between realism and simplicity.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
      This project was a test of both my modeling intuition and coding precision. Writing a pricing engine from scratch—one that balanced theoretical rigor with practical speed—wasn’t easy. But I walked away with a stronger sense of how real-world derivatives get priced, and why the simplest models often hide the deepest challenges.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Going forward, I’d like to explore real-time pricing APIs, calibrate the Heston model to historical data, and maybe even try pricing American-style barrier options.
      </p>
