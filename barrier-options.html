    <h1>Pricing Foreign Exchange Barrier Options via Stochastic Simulation</h1>

      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>
      This paper grew out of a longer-standing interest I’ve had in using simulation to solve problems where closed-form solutions break down. I’d studied European option pricing before, but barrier options seemed like a natural next step—technically richer, more sensitive to model structure, and deeply rooted in practical finance.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      My goal was to understand the complications of pricing path-dependent derivatives and experiment with methods that mitigate the well-known challenges of simulating rare path behavior. I wanted to implement everything from scratch—model, paths, controls, even variance reduction—both to understand how they work and to explore the limits of pure simulation.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Modeling the FX Rate</h2>
      <p>
      To simulate barrier options in an FX setting, I modeled the spot rate \( S_t \) under two stochastic processes. First, I implemented the classical geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model, which assumes constant volatility and continuous compounding — the standard in Black-Scholes-Merton-style approaches. Then, to better account for empirical volatility clustering and smile/skew effects in FX markets, I extended the simulation to incorporate the Heston model, which introduces a stochastic variance component following its own mean-reverting CIR process.
      </p>

      <p>
      Using Monte Carlo simulation, I generated thousands of synthetic price paths and computed expected payoffs. However, simulating barrier options naïvely introduces significant variance and discretization bias, especially when monitoring is discrete (e.g. daily or hourly).
      </p>
      
      <h2>Variance Reduction and Interpolation</h2>
      <p>
      When simulating discrete monitoring of barrier options, many paths might avoid detection despite likely breaching the barrier between time steps. To mitigate this, I incorporated a Brownian bridge adjustment that estimates the probability of a crossing event between discrete points. This approach adds a penalty (or discount) for borderline paths, significantly improving pricing accuracy in high-volatility or near-barrier scenarios.
      </p>

      <p class="caption">

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
      Simulation under GBM gave reasonable estimates but struggled in scenarios with low volatility or tight barriers. The variance reduction techniques dramatically improved convergence and reduced standard error. Brownian bridge interpolation made a measurable difference in correctly classifying knock-outs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The Heston model added computational cost but yielded more realistic dynamics, especially for FX options. It captured “fat tails” and volatility smiles that GBM couldn’t replicate. I ran empirical tests comparing both models across multiple scenarios and found clear tradeoffs between realism and simplicity.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
      This project was a test of both my modeling intuition and coding precision. Writing a pricing engine from scratch—one that balanced theoretical rigor with practical speed—wasn’t easy. But I walked away with a stronger sense of how real-world derivatives get priced, and why the simplest models often hide the deepest challenges.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Going forward, I’d like to explore real-time pricing APIs, calibrate the Heston model to historical data, and maybe even try pricing American-style barrier options.
      </p>
