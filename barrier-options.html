      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>
      For the past five weeks, I had the opportunity to research and write a paper on a mathematical topic of my choosing through the Independent Research and Paper Writing class offered by <a href="https://eulercircle.com/" target="_blank">Euler Circle</a>. This was my second time taking the class: two summers earlier, I wrote a paper on variational calculus (and the Brachistochrone problem in particular) under the guidance of Euler Circle director Simon Rubenstein-Salzedo and Stanford undergraduate Leonardo Bonanno. This time around, however, I was much more familiar with the process of writing mathematical papers, and wanted to contribute my own analysis to the project rather than merely amalgamating what I'd learned from a variety of sources. I also wanted to research something in applied math, which recently has piqued my interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon explaining this to Simon, he suggested I research Brownian motion, which I ended up taking in a financial context and transitioning it to barrier options, which are heavily tied to Brownian motion. Below is a more generally comprehensible summary of my work, though it does assume intermediate knowledge of probability theory and economics. (I think a standard understanding of each of these subjects would be enough to grasp most of what is mentioned, which should hopefully be interesting enough.)
      </p>
      
      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you to Daniel Naylor for providing valuable mentorship and support during the research and writing phases of this paper, and to Euler Circle organization and Dr. Simon Rubinstein-Salzedo, who provided the resources and platform necessary to conduct this project. All resources I used while conducting my research can be found in the full paper, which is attached at the bottom of this page.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Modeling the FX Rate</h2>
      <p>
      To simulate barrier options in an FX setting, I modeled the spot rate under two stochastic processes. First, I implemented the classical geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model, which assumes constant volatility and continuous compounding. Then, to incorporate more realistic volatility seen in FX markets, I extended the simulation to include the Heston model, which introduces a stochastic variance component following its own mean-reverting process.

      <p class="caption"> Sample paths of the FX spot rate under geometric Brownian motion used in Monte Carlo simulation.</p>
      
      <p>
      Using Monte Carlo simulation, I generated thousands of synthetic price paths and computed expected payoffs.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Variance Reduction</h2>

      <p>
      Unfortunatelly, simulating barrier options using Monte Carlo naively introduces significant variance and discretization bias, especially when monitoring is discrete. To work around this, I looked into variance reduction strategies. First, I discovered antithetic variates, which was easy to implement and extremely beneficial for reducing variance; for each simulated path, I mirrored its Brownian motion with a negatively correlated twin, which alone helped tighten the confidence intervals.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Additionally, the discontinuity in naive simulations can often lead to missing a barrier breach, as monitoring typically isn't continuous. To fix this, I implemented Brownian bridge interpolation, which estimates the likelihood of the barrier being breached between discrete time steps. Conceptually, it "fills in the gaps" in each path, which makes the simulation more robust. When interpolated, paths that initially appeared to survive might reveal that they likely crossed the barrier after all.

      <p class="caption"> Two FX paths (dashed) that survive discrete monitoring yet likely breach the barrier when interpolated. Brownian bridge adjustment penalizes these cases. </p>
      
      <h2>Results</h2>
      
      <p>
      Once everything was in place, I ran experiments across both knock-in and knock-out options under different volatilities, interest rate spreads, and barrier levels. I began with the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model and later compared those results to the more nuanced Heston model with stochastic volatility.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      One thing worth mentioning is that the barrier‚Äôs relative distance from the current spot price had a noticeably huge influence, almost more so than the volatility itself. When the barrier was set just outside the likely range of the simulated paths, small changes in volatility or monitoring frequency could engender vast shifts in the payoff probability.
      </p>

      
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Regardless of whether or not I end up going deeper into finance later on, I truly am happy to have learned lots about a specific area of it. I enjoy exploring the versatility of math in other fields of study, and I haven't studied finance extensively before, so it was entirely new to me. Yet the research process didn't feel any more difficult or boring to me, and I was able to bring concepts and subjects from math that I'd learned previously to do something new (and write a paper, which is something that I wanted to experience more of). I'm glad I took the class, even when it overlapped with some other summer activities, and I really did learn a lot.
